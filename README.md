My First Ever Flutter Application. It was a wonderful experience when I first time used my own made App!!

## What's it about?

It is an application with simple user interface with a home screen. The main dialogue is for generating a random word pair. Yesss, Indeed.. it does it. And sometime a cool combination of two words and sometime awful. :D

## Features

1. Here you can generate random words for sure.
2. You can also add a newly generated word into your favorites.

## Future? Hmmm...

It's the simplest I could start with. It will give me a good base. I learnt [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides) Dart Language from official docs. Then [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev) and tried out [this one](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab).

It gave me a good intro to Flutter. Going Ahead, will keep it as reference and try to add more functionality to it.

# Getting Started

## Downloading the application

1.  Download the apk from release page (for android).
